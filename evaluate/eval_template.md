## Rules 

Now please compare Response A and Response B based on the above aspects. 
You should first use a few short sentences to briefly show your assessment according to the given aspects.
You have three choices to give final assessment: ["A", "B", "tie"].
- Select `A` only when Response A is *noticeably* better than Response B.
- Select `B` only when Response B is *noticeably* better than Response A.
- Select `tie` when Response A and B are of *roughly similar* quality. 

For example, if both responses are factually accurate, with no significant errors in the information provided. Choose `tie` for the `factuality` aspect. If one response has more content, which is not more particularly helpful, choose `tie` on the `helpfulness` aspect.
